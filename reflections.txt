reflection: manual commits:
     auto-saving - is mainly to prevent user error for not saving "commit" points
     -have more control in manual commits


command
git diff <commitID> <commitID2>
     

reflection: multi-file commits
     git is designed for coding unlike the other mentioned version control which is designed for writing "non-code" which most of the time requires just one file


reflection: using git to view history
     check bugs, or want to revert something back




reflection: confidence from version control
     more confident, gets you to check what causes an error


reflection: how do you want to use git?
-all my coding stuffs
