initializing a repository
	it groups all the files in the folder so it can be commited as a group.

staging area
staging area prepares what files you need to commit. more like a safety check for what files you need to commit

commit size
we can add individual files to stage, to make sure it's just one logical change per commit
separating the changes

reflection: when to use branches
-when adding totally new feature, creating new versions, really subjective
-new piece of work
-branches help as it starts a new thread in which to experiment and still have a working version


visualizing with diagrams
very helpful as to see the branches makes it easier to wrap head around


merging two branches
it combines both branches, the commits for both branches have been connected into one commit

automatic vs manual merging
git has a way to automatically merge files but if there confilicts has to be done manually

git is smart enought to identify the differences and will do it automatically. but there will be instances where two branches will have conflicting changes and has to be reviewed manually
